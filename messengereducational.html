            <br>    
                
            1.	It can make students and teachers lives easier by eliminating paper and expensive software’s. 
                
            <br>   
                
            2.	You can share multimedia.
                
            <br>       

            For example if there was a group doing a project on a topic:
                
            <br>       

            The teacher could communicate the project with the students and all the details and post anything necessary to do it, instantly to a large group of students.
                
            <br>
                
            The students and teachers can share any multimedia to each other. For example learning resources like videos or links to websites… or any sort of project the students create, they can share it.
                
            <br>  
                
            A teacher wants some students to do a project on games. They will send a group of students individually what they have to do for the project and how it will be graded. They will send them links to start off or to learn about the topic, websites, videos, etc. 
                
            <br>    

            The students doing the project create their own group chat and assign project roles and talk about how they are going to execute the project. They can use the resources and their research to accomplish the project within the grading guide set by the teacher by sharing information.
                
            <br>    

            Then the students decide to create a YouTube video and a website displaying their project and make some sketches for a game of their own.

            </div>
            
        <div class="item four">
            
            <p class="p3">They can then share the links with the teacher for the video, website and whatever content each student made.
                
            <br>    

            For example they list what each student did and then get one student to send everything to the teacher. For example a website link, a YouTube video link, pictures of sketches, etc.. 
                
            <br>        

            3.  Posting class notes and assigning homework:
                
            <br>        

            If a student is out or if the teacher is out, or if they just need to share homework they can instantly to all their students. 
                
            <br>    

            4.  Students can share ideas
                
            <br>    

            They can all talk on messenger about anything including whatever they are learning.
            They can create a group chat for a topic or chapter or just for just for their class and discuss it.
            Some people learn better from working with others so this would help also.
            Even if you don’t you can still get ideas from others or share yours.</p>
