        <p>When using any social media app in general, there will always be an issue with safety. Using them with caution can minimize the risk but you will never truly be safe when using them as information gets leaked all the time. The best practice is to only put up and share information that you feel comfortable with everyone knowing.</p><br>
        
        <p>Some basic things you should know:</p><br>
        
        <p>Don’t share your password with anyone.</p><br>
            
        <p>Even if you keep your account limited or private, it can still reach a wider audience.</p><br>
            
        <p>Think about what you’re posting. Can someone find you through the picture?</p><br>
            
        <p>Instagram isn’t reality as people only post the best parts of their life.</p>

        <p>With Instagram in general, there are many ways that you can stay protected. One of the easiest ways is to put your account on private. This will restrict access to your account, meaning no one can view your posts unless they follow you. People can request to follow you but is it your decision whether you want them to be able to view your account. You also have the option to choose who can comment on your posts. Your Instagram Stories are also private.</p><br>
        
        <p>However, if your account is set on private, your profile is still public so they can see your profile photo, bio and username. This shouldn’t be an issue as long as you don’t have any information you’re not comfortable sharing with everyone.</p><br>
        
        <p>When posting pictures on Instagram, you should keep in mind the location setting and the tags you use. These could easily show your location to people. Tags can also be used to see your interests and your location so use them with caution.</p>    
    
        </div>
        
    <div class="general2">
        
        <p>You should also be careful when sharing beyond Instagram. If you have any other accounts on other sites like Facebook and they aren’t private, it could be shared to everyone.</p><br>
        
        <p>People can also get to your account if you like other people’s post and if you’re tagged in their posts or stories. You can un-tag your account from posts but you can’t from stories so you can ask the person to remove you from the story. Stories aren’t permanent so after 24 hours they get removed.</p><br>
        
        <p>If someone is harassing you, you can always block them and report them to Instagram. Try your best to ignore them and don’t post anything to aggravate them. You can also report people if they’re impersonating you or if they are a spam account.</p><br>
        
        <p>If you take these cautions into consideration, you can minimize the risk that comes with Instagram.</p>
