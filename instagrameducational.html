            <p class="p1">Teaching and learning can be improved by using social media in education nowadays. Social media and technology has become a huge part of our daily lives with the majority of adults and teenagers with at least one or two different social media tools or apps which can be accessed from many devices. Since we all still use these apps, there are definitely ways to implement them into education. Some ways benefits and approaches to using social media in education are:
            
            <br>
            
            1.	Communication<br>
            This one of the biggest advantages to social media, it gives great access to communicate to anyone around the world. Students can connect with their fellow students and teachers easily and from a wide range of devices from mobile phones to PCâ€™s.

            2.	Collaboration<br>

            3.	Finding information and inspiration<br>

            4.	Parents Involvement<br> 
            Social Media in Education also helps parents to be connected and involved in the students learning. If the school has a Twitter or Facebook page, parents and students can follow to be updated on the latest news, projects and achievements.

            5.	Improved Literacy, Communication and Reading Skill<br>

It gives students a different medium to learn which can help with making learning easier.

            Instagram is a social app that can be used for teaching and learning in Education. There are over 1 Billion users on Instagram with 72% being teenagers. 35% of the teenagers in the US said that Instagram is their preferred social media platform. This just shows that Instagram has a huge potential to be used in Education. 
            One of the first things a teacher should do if wanting to use Instagram as an educational tool is to set up a private classroom account which every student can join and follow. Then following from that, here are a few examples of how Instagram can be used for the purpose of Education in a classroom:

            <p class="p1">2.	Capture Memories<br> 
            A teacher can post pictures of a lot of the memories made in class. This can be from regular days in class, to going on a trip or completing cool activities. This can remind the students of these memories and also allow their parents to see all the interesting things their children are doing at school.

            3.	Show Students Work<br> 
            Instagram is a perfect place to showcase students' works and achievements, since it works on a basis of posting pictures with a caption underneath. The class account can act as a place to post award winning projects and achievements that the students have made.

            4.	Help Students<br> 
            Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects. They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. The comments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of one another that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask a question relating to a post privately if they don't want to comment.
